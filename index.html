				Hi! My name is Gwen, and welcome to my photography portfolio. I've been an avid photographer for over 10 years, and am attempting to display my favorite works on this site. I'm passionate about portrait photography, particularly senior, engagement, graduation, and headshot portraits. I am also highly experienced in stage and event photography, and have experience in fashion, food, product, lifestyle, fine art, editorial, photojournalism, and editorial photography. I've wanted to break into the rock climbing photography world for ages now. However, I need to get better equipment to do this - please contact me here if you would like to go on a climbing photography trip with me!

				While I'm not photographing clients, I am studying for my Master's of Science in Information at the University of Michigan School of Information, specializing in UX Research and Design, Human Computer Interaction, and Social Computing. To see my UX/UI portfolio, see here, or to see my photography website, see here. Additionally, I have a Linkedin for professional purposes located here. I also am constantly traveling, and enjoy using film and phone photography to capture my adventures. Travel photography is another field I have been wanting to break into, please contact me here if you would like to plan a trip.

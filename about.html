				Hello!  My name is Gwen McKee and I'm an alumnus of the University of Michigan with a B.A. in History and a minor in Digital Studies. I’m currently studying for my Master’s of Science in Information at the University of Michigan on the UX/UI/Human Computer Interaction track. I grew up in Ann Arbor, and have lived here my entire life.

				I have been interested in photography since I started out with a humble Canon Powershot at the age of 10, doing macro and landscape photography of everything and anything I saw that caught my eye. With the upgraded equipment of a Canon T2i DSLR, I moved on to portrait and performance photography, and built up my professional photography business, which I have run for around 10 years. I currently use a Canon 6D full frame DSLR alongside 50mm f/1.2 + 80mm f/1.8 lenses. I use Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom for editing.
			</p>

			<p>
				At university, I was the resident photographer for Basement Arts theater, and was a photographer for SHEI magazine (fashion), SHIFT magazine (lifestyle) and Wolverine Cuizine magazine (food). I have also done photography for MUSKET theater, RC Players theater, Rude Mechanicals theater, Music Matters, Angels on Call,  Bronze Elegance Fashion, and Helicon art club. I have been offered an internship with Jess and Nate Studios, and have shot with photographer Hayden Stinebaugh. I have photographed notable people such as Common, Migos, Futuristic, Sam Lachow, and Darren Criss.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Outside of photography, I dabble in graphic and website design, film, painting and drawing. I have a huge passion for theater - I have been involved in it since the age of 10 and was involved in four theater groups on campus in everything from stage management to props to acting, as well as being the president of my high school theater club. I am additionally passionate about concert production and management, rock climbing, adventure travel, nature, environmental rights, archaeology, classics, and innovative technologies.
			</p>

			<p>
				Currently, I work with an international company based in Japan as the Director of Design, Technology, and Digital Strategy to develop programs that create a more globalized and connected international world. Additionally, I just completed an internship with the U.S. Department of State doing UX design and strategy for embassy and state websites.
